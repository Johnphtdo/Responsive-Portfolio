      <img src="assets/images/5D6A6715.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington on December 2015. I went into the investment and
        banking
        industry starting as a data entry associate and advancing towards to becoming a Remediation Analyst for
        Anti-Money Laundering(AML).</p>

      <p>I am currently enrolled full time in the Full Stack Flex program at the Southern Methodist University. The
        program covers materials
        to meet market demands, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Java, Express.js, React.js, Database
        Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, and Git
        to aspiring Web Developers. </p>

        for any employer.</p>
